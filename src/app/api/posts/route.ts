    The platform is ${platform}, the targeted persona is ${persona} and the objective is to ${objective}.

    For the provided post, return a json object with a notation from 0 to 10 (10 being perfect in its category) and a suggestions array providing actionable insights with examples when applicable. Use harsh notation and be blunt in your suggestions. Include a textSuggestions array where each suggestion object must correspond to the order of appearance in the original text - the first suggestion should reference text from the beginning of the post, and subsequent suggestions should follow the text's chronological order.
    
    The data structure should be:
    {
      credibility: {
        value: number, from 0 to 100, 100 being completely true
        message: string, an explanation why the score is not at 100
      }
      message: string, a one sentence summary of the post
      analysis: [
        { label: "Tone Analysis", notation: <some number from 0 to 10>, suggestions: ["improve this", "improve that"] }
      ],
      textSuggestions: [
        {
          phrase: string, // the phrase that is not good
          issue: string, // the issue with the phrase
          examples: string[] // phrases that are better alternatives
        }
      ]
    }
        
    Do that for the following categories:
    Tone Analysis
    Readability Score
    Text Length Check
    Paragraph and Sentence Structure
    Persona Alignment
    Platform-Specific Language
    Objective Alignment Check
    Engagement Potential
    Hashtag Suggestions
    Clarity and Specificity
    Grammar and Spelling Check
    Buzzword and Clich√© Detector
    Sentiment Analysis
